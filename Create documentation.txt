Navigate to the project directory:

bash
Copy code
cd react-contact-form
Install dependencies:

bash
Copy code

2. Component Structure
The application consists of a main App component, which wraps the ContactForm component.

ContactForm component:
State:

firstName: Contains the first name value.
lastName: Contains the last name value.
email: Contains the email value.
message: Contains the message value.
errors: Object that holds any validation error messages.
Methods:

handleInputChange: Updates the state based on input changes.
validateForm: Validates the form fields.
handleSubmit: Manages form submission and error handling.
3. Field Validations
For each of the form fields, the following validations are applied:

First Name & Last Name:

Must not be empty.
Should only contain alphabetic characters.
Email:

Must not be empty.
Should be a valid email format (e.g., user@example.com).
Message:

Must not be empty.
Has a minimum length of 10 characters.
4. Submitting the Form
On clicking the submit button, the handleSubmit method is triggered.
If there are any validation errors, they will be set in the errors state and displayed to the user.
If there are no validation errors, the form data will be sent to the backend or any appropriate endpoint (this part needs backend integration).
5. Styling & Appearance
The application uses [CSS_MODULE_NAME] for styling, providing a clean and user-friendly UI. To modify the styling:

Navigate to the styles directory.
Update the corresponding CSS file to make any design or appearance changes.
Note: Ensure that you do not remove any class names or IDs used by the JavaScript code for functionality, as this could disrupt the app's behavior.

Additional Notes
Ensure that the backend endpoint is set up to handle POST requests from this application. This documentation doesn't cover backend setup.
